# CONAN

CONAN (not related with mythical barabarian character) is a CONtrast ANalyzer.
It can be used to quickly analyze the optimal *min* and *max* values to 
visualize a given image. It has optimal usage when your data has some outliers
that disturb visualization using minimum and maximum values.

# How it works?

It starts using non-parametric statistical analysis in Fourier Domain
with crossvalidation to find the optimal bandwidth in a Kernel Density 
Estimator.

Then it uses mode traces to find the most proeminent modes in estimation and
evaluates the minimum and maximum data points for visualization contrast.
